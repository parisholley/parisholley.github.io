				<h2 class="role__title">Entrepreneur</h2>

				<p class="role__desc">After consulting for over six years in an enterprise software environment, it was time for me to give
					business ownership a shot. In 2013, my partners and I went on to form our own company which turned profitable within two
					years with over $1 million in revenue.</p>

				<h2 class="role__title">Programmer</h2>

				<p class="role__desc">Having sat in front of a computer since a toddler, technology has become second nature to me. In grade
					school, I began my freelancing career that would eventually lead to consulting after graduating high school. From
					infrastracture to the web, I am a jack-of-all trades.</p>

				<h2 class="role__title">Musician</h2>

				<p class="role__desc">Coming from a family of singers, producers and actresses, entertainment runs through my bones. While
					I am still on a journey (perhaps a life long one) to determine where I fit in the mix, I do dabble here and there
					(mostly rap).</p>

				<h2 class="role__title">Photographer</h2>

				<p class="role__desc">While taking pictures with an expensive camera doesnâ€™t make you a photographer, it has a nice ring to
					it! In 2013 I traveled the country to find the best hiking I could and in the process found my inner photog. Some day I
					will do more than point and shoot.</p>
